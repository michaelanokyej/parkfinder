# Parkfinder WebApp

An andventure driven web-app that searches for parks. Users can search for national parks in and out of their states. Parks are always shown with the current weather and the weather throughout the day for the location.  

## Motivation

I wanted to create an app that will tell me about all the national parks near me regardless where I am and give me a link to the park's website.
